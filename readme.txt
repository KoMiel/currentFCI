The file 'currentFCI.R' includes our adaptations to the FCI algorithm (based on the package pcalg).

Simulations:
1_simulations.R simulates the data.
2_modelling.R infers graphical models.
3_evaluation.R compares the inferred models and the true underlying models.

Case study:
1_importHydrosheds.R, 2_linkingHydrosheds.R and 3_upstreamHydrosheds.R apply the spatial structure to the system.
4_modelling.R infers graphical models.
